This is the help file for my wonderful application.
<br/>
<p>This web application, Eat It, is a list-based application created for users to be able to keep track of their favorite bars and restaurants. The application has a standard username and password login feature, as well as a one-time password sent via email at every login attempt, for extra security.</p>
<p>Once inside the application, a user may enter the name of any location they would like under My Favorite Spots. All they have to do is enter the name into a text box, select the Choose File button if they would like to add a file, and select the Add Location button to add their new favorite spot to the list. All locations are listed together in chronological order. If a user would like to add or view more details, they can select the text of a location name. This will bring them to that locationâ€™s specific page, where they have freedom to add any comment they like, such as details about specials, hours, favorite employees, addresses, or phone numbers. Like the My Favorite Spots page, they simply enter whatever information they would like into the text box, upload any files they desire (perhaps a menu, a photo of the restaurant, or a favorite dish) and select the Add Comment button to save their information. The data entered will be displayed in a list style. To return to the main list, a user may select the List button on the top right menu.</p>
<p>If a user does not yet have an account, they should go to the registration page by either selecting the Registration button in the top right corner, or selecting create an account underneath the login form. On the registration page, they should fill out the form with a chosen username, password, email address, and registration code, then select the Register button. If they leave any information out or choose a taken username, they will be notified and asked to resubmit.</p>
<p>If a user has an account, but has forgotten their password, they may select Forgot Password under the login page login form. They will be taken to a page to enter their email, which will send a reset link upon submission. After clicking the link in their email, they will be taken to a page with a form to select and verify a new password.</p>
<p>Alongside the List button is the Profile button, which will take a user to a page that will allow them to edit their profile. Their username and email will already be listed but the password will not display. To update any information, the user can type in new information into the text box of their desire and select the Update Profile button. Username changes will be automatic, but email and password changes will send an email with a link to verify that the user is who they say they are.</p>
<p>The Help button will bring the user to a page with brief instructions on various features, and in the near future, a button to send messages regarding feature requests.</p>
<p>The Home button will bring a user to the front page of the app, which states the purpose of the app and contains links to the login and register page.</p>
<p>Finally, the logout button will log the user out of their account until they are ready to return to add or collect more information. </p>
